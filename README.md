# [Web Prototype](https://moggrat.itch.io/moon-miss-shot)

## Development Background:

Moon Miss Shot was created for the [GitHub Game Off 2020 Game jam](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2020). This prototype game was created in Unity with some of the free time I've had in November.

The theme was MOONSHOT. This theme alongside other inspirations resulted in me developing a gravity system and the game around this system.
